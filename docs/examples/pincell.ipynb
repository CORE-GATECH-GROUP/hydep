If one was to model depletion with a fine time scale, the computational resources required for an accurate and stable Monte Carlo solution can become burdensome. The simulation time can be reduced by exchanging some or many of the high-fidelity solutions with faster reduced-order simulations. The cost of this exchange is related to the accuracy of the reduced-order code.\n",

This is enabled by the abstraction of the solvers away from the classes responsible for depleting and marching forward in time, similar to the design of `openmc.deplete`.

    "The goal of this approach is to reduce the amount of information that must be updated in order to switch between supported transport solvers. In theory, one could swap out a different high-fidelity solver, update a few lines of the configuration file, and the framework would be able to run without a problem. This is a difficult claim to prove, given only a single high-fidelity solver is supported at the moment. But the design of the interfaces and reliance on abstraction are indications that this claim has merit."
