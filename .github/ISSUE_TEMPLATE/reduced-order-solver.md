name: Reduced order solver
about: Propose a new reduced-order solver interface
title: "[RO] <X> as a reduced-order solver"
labels: enhancement, interface:ro
assignees: ''

## Overview
Please describe the solver, in particular

- Where is this solver documented?
- How can the solver be obtained? This helps with installation and testing
- summary of transport capabilities (e.g. flexibility of tallies, homogenization, continuous energy or multi-group, etc.)
- summary of geometry modeling (CSG like a Monte Carlo code, assembly homogenization like nodal diffusion code, smaller discrete zones like deterministic transport)

## Development

- Are you willing to develop this interface? If not, do you know someone with the knowledge to do it? Please link them in the issue
- Will you (or the developer linked previously) help maintain it?
- How can this be tested? Writing input files can be done w/o running the executable, but may be more error prone unless we can run the solver in the test environment
